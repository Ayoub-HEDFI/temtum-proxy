For the server, npm i {list of packages in the head of the fiel}

For the client App:
 - Python verion: donwload pyinstaller : pip3 instal pyinstaller
 - pyinstaller --onefile ssh_tunnel_app.py ==> this will run the build of the executable binary based on the platform (OS)
 need to make a solution for that (either lambda to call a build in separate VMs (windows,linux,mac) or make multi build for each  user)
